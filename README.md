This is the main repository for the Qiskit Fall Fest 2022 being hosted at NSUT Delhi, India. 

## Welcome!
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for NSUT, Delhi. We're so excited to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the IOSD NSUT, Delhi in collaboration with IBM Qiskit Advocates from NSUT.

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here on NSUT is going to be a mix of _workshops followed by an online challenge_, with **prizes sponsored by IBM Quantum!**
Starting from October 3rd. The details and timeline about the event are going to be posted here in a few days, so stay tuned
